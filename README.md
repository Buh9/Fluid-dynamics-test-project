# Fluid Dynamics
**VERSION 0.0.1:**
This is a fluid dynamics program using SPH(Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics) created using glut/opengl 3d, this is also probably very broken at it's current state

## How to run it
I am too lazy to run this on other operating systems(plus Apple has removed all openGL support), you will need some version of linux(possibly you can use WSL?) and have installed all the prerequsites. 

**First:** clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Buh9/Fluid-dynamic-stupid-thing.git
```

**Next:** Build the software (you may need superuser previlages)

```bash
make clean install
```

**PREREQUISITES**

![gcc/g++](git://gcc.gnu.org/git/gcc.git)
